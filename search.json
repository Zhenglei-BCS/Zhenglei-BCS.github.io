    "section": "",
    "text": "I have learned a great deal from my involvement in the R Validation Hub. riskassessment and riskmetric are the two packages needed to generate a risk assessment report for a “standard” R package.\nThe validation philosophy proposed in this white paper is a valuable resource to understand the general concerns and has helped shape my own thoughts on the validation strategy of a self-developed R-package or a tool.\nOne aspect that has consistently puzzled me is the tendency to consider software from third-party vendors as trustworthy, despite my experience as a statistician uncovering errors or bugs in such software. Conversely, in-house developed tools are subjected to much greater scrutiny. This discrepancy in perceptions between the QAs, project managers, and subject matter experts has highlighted the need for clear communication and a shared commitment to bridge the gap.\nI find it challenging to cultivate a robust ecosystem for leveraging open-source tools such as R for GxP purpose analyses. I believe rigorous validation of both open-source tools and commercial tools for GxP purposes is necessary, irrespective of their origin. It is my hope that through my advocacy efforts, I can contribute to the establishment of a more inclusive and reliable ecosystem for statistical analyses in regulated environments within my area of expertise.\n\nAn excerpt from that white paper.\n\n\n6.5. Vendor Assessments and Trusted Resources\n\n\nFor proprietary software it is common to perform vendor assessments / audits to explore the internal validation practices of the vendor. If a company is satisfied with the internal validation practices of the vendor, they may designate the vendor a ’trusted’ status. The impact of this might be that any software produced by that vendor is deemed to be low risk.\n\n\nFor open source software such audits are not logistically feasible. However, based on information available in the open source domain, it may still be possible to perform a virtual audit of a vendor and their practices. For example, R Foundation and R Core team, have published information about their practices in R: Regulatory Compliance and Validation Issues. A Guidance Document for the Use of R in Regulated Clinical Trial Environments. It is the opinion of the R Validation Hub that this is sufficient to allocate the R Foundation a trusted status. This would render the collection of Base R and Recommended packages low risk as a result."
